## Overview

**Device-for-Alleviating-Loneliness-in-the-Elderly** is an interactive solution designed to help reduce feelings of loneliness among elderly individuals. This project leverages user-friendly design and technology to foster social connection and emotional well-being.Inspired by “How might we develop a fun, engaging way to encourage intergenerational interactions for senior citizens who are socially isolated in Singapore?​”

Methodology 
A design thinking approach will be used, focusing on the iterative process of prototyping, testing, and refining based on user feedback. The main phases are as follows: 
1.Prototype development based on existing insights  
2.Iterative refinement and testing 
3.Final prototype evaluation and completion

## Project Background

This project began with extensive research into the psychological and social challenges faced by the elderly, especially those living alone.  
Early stages included:
- Interviews with elderly users and caregivers
- Review of current assistive technologies
- Ideation and prototyping sessions
- Needs assessment and market research

Key insights from the preliminary work directly shaped the device’s user-centered features and functions.
