## Overview

**Device-for-Alleviating-Loneliness-in-the-Elderly** is an interactive solution designed to help reduce feelings of loneliness among elderly individuals. This project leverages user-friendly design and technology to foster social connection and emotional well-being.Inspired by “How might we develop a fun, engaging way to encourage intergenerational interactions for senior citizens who are socially isolated in Singapore?​”

Methodology：

1.Prototype Development
Initial prototypes are created based on research insights and identified user needs.

2.Iterative Refinement and Testing
Prototypes are repeatedly tested and refined through cycles of user evaluation and feedback.

3.Final Evaluation and Completion
The refined prototype undergoes final evaluation to ensure it meets user requirements, followed by project completion.

## Project Background

This project began with extensive research into the psychological and social challenges faced by the elderly, especially those living alone.  
Early stages included:
- Interviews with elderly users and caregivers
- Review of current assistive technologies
- Ideation and prototyping sessions
- Needs assessment and market research

Key insights from the preliminary work directly shaped the device’s user-centered features and functions.
